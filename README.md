# Continued Fractions

Given a continued fraction it computes the square (I needed it for my masters thesis).
I'm using the algorithm described (and proven) in: "Algebraic computations with continued fractions" by Pierre Liardet and Pierre Stambul in J. Number Theory 73 (1998), no. 1, 92-121.

It was my first small project on Python, so it is a little messy, but it does work.
I'm planning on refining it at some point.
